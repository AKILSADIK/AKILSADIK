## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘‹ Hello, World! I'm a passionate and dedicated developer with expertise in a diverse set of languages and technologies. I have a strong command over **Python**, **Java**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. I'm also proficient in the **MERN stack**, giving me the ability to create dynamic and interactive web applications.

I have hands-on experience with **Flutter**, allowing me to craft beautiful and natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. My knowledge of **SQL** and **AWS** equips me to handle databases and cloud services effectively.

What sets me apart is my interest and expertise in **Speech Recognition Models** and **Generative AI**. I'm always excited to explore the endless possibilities these technologies offer.

I believe in the power of code to transform and simplify life, and I'm always ready to learn and grow. Let's code, collaborate, and create together! ðŸ’»ðŸš€
